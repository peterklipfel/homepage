Phlogiston Miasma And Dark Matter
===


Before chemistry, there was phlogiston; before germ theory, there was miasma.  Now we have a theory of dark matter that is reminiscent of both phlogiston and miasma.  The most fascinating part about miasma and phlogiston is that they were so close to the theories that replaced them.  It might have been possible to generalize the theories into what is now held to be correct; however, the naming of things would have been quite confusing.  The new theories provided new language for the subjects and opened new doors for science and technology.

Phlogiston can be thought of, loosely, as the inverse of oxygen.  “Phlogiston was considered to be an element that was contained in all combustible substances and in metals and escaped on burning or rusting.  The residues’ of substances remaining after phlogiston had escaped could be converted to their original form by adding phlogiston” (Soloveichik).  It is even possible to write about phlogiston theory in terms of chemistry.  “Rutherford regarded... hydrogen as another kind of phlogisticated air produced by the union of pure phlogiston with atmospheric air” (Weeks). Of course, the scientists of the time weren’t writing about phlogiston in terms of chemistry; my point is to show how closely related they are.  It is also interesting to note that Weeks is talking about Ernest Rutherford.  The scientists that subscribed to phlogiston theory were not slouches.  Rutherford was a great physicist and made huge contributions to nuclear physics.

There was a large quantity of literature written on phlogiston before and after the invention of chemistry.  The literature is often quite precise in its description of the properties of phlogiston.  Reading this literature is sometimes quite frustrating because the researchers were so close to a much deeper understanding of natural phenomena.  They had the facts that they needed; all that needed to be done was to compile them into a clever, coherent theory.  The following is an excerpt from a paper that explains many phenomena associated with phlogisticated air and its interactions with other materials:

<div class="quote">
  <p>
    [Phlogisticated air] density, compared with that of ordinary air, is as 15 1/2 or 16 to 9... It has an agreeable taste and smell; and it changes the color of syrup of violets from blue to purple.  It prevents putrefaction, but putrefied bodies are not made fresh by it.  It possesses the power of combining with lime, which acquires new properties as the result of its action - (Ramsay)

Today, if phlogiston theory was dominant, critics might say that replacing it with chemistry is inelegant because chemistry appears to be much more complicated than phlogiston theory.  Phlogiston is elegant because it can explain many phenomena with a single entity – the presence, or lack of, phlogiston.  When Lavoisier postulated Oxygen, the phlogiston theorists of the time rejected the theory.  Priestley had difficulty reproducing Lavoisier’s results, and rejected the theory of chemistry (Priestley and Banks).

Miasma, like phlogiston theory was close to the right answer.  “[Miasma theory] held that most, if not all, disease was caused by inhaling air that was infected through exposure to ... rotting corpses, the exhalations of other people already infected, sewage, or even rotting vegetation” (Halliday).  These are all places that one would expect to find harmful bacteria.  Again, miasma is a rather elegant theory because it can explain all disease with a single mechanism.  It is simpler to imagine that: “[odorous objects] gave off miasmas or effluvia which were themselves disease entities infecting those coming under their influence”(Porter) than it is to imagine that there are millions of tiny constituents that each contribute to the sickness of an individual.  Miasma seems more tangible.

Interestingly, there was a theory that involved the subdivision of miasma to account for sickness.  “The concentration of miasmata, the airborne organic particles, resulting from these processes was greatest at lower elevation, and it could be expected to decrease at a regular rate as one ascended the sides of the river basin” (Eyler).  This law was discovered by William Farr, a British epidemiologist.  Had Farr taken this theory farther, it’s possible that germs would have been called “miasmata”.  It is also worth pointing out that there were conferences and conventions that studied miasma, and that  “[e]ach convention had a committee investigating ‘the nature and sources of miasmata’ which faithfully turned in reports attributing fevers to decaying vegetation, to an invisible but detectable (method unstated) ‘malaria’ or miasma, and to the presence of offensive effluvia from slaughterhouses, swamps, cesspools, and sewers” (Richmond).  If one is only given is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  This represents an important departure from Baconian ideals.  Bacon would have scoffed at these conclusions, because the researchers were finding what they expect to find rather than finding new patterns and phenomena from the given data.

Now that the reader has some background for the predecessors of modern chemistry and germ theory, I can compare and contrast dark matter.  The first time someone provided evidence for what is now known as dark matter was Friedrich Willhelm in 1844.  Almost 90 years later, Jan Oort and Fritz Zwicky found better evidence for dark matter by investigating the speeds at which stellar bodies were travelling (Trimble).  Soon after, Horace Babcock then found in 1939 that galaxies were rotating much faster than classical mechanics predicted (Bergh).  The only way to explain galaxies not flying apart is the presence of more gravity, and the only way we know how to add gravity is to add mass.  So we explain away these anomalies with an ethereal, non-luminous matter that comprises large portions of galaxies.

If we don’t see any more mass, then it’s possible that there is more mass there, and we just aren’t seeing it; hence the name “dark matter”.  We can solve this problem by summoning a new particle called a weakly interacting massive particle, or WIMP.  These particles only interact with the weak force – as opposed to the strong and electromagnetic forces.  And now all we need to do is find these WIMPS.  We have actually found weakly interacting particles called neutrinos (the things that were incorrectly reported to travel faster than the speed of light).  However, the problem with finding dark matter is that we can’t see it, and it is drowned out by neutrinos (Spergel).    Now we have to find a needle in a haystack in order to prove that dark matter exists.

At this point, it is easy to dive into the theory and wonder whether we are going to find the needle or not.  But let’s stop for a minute and remember what it was like for the phlogiston and miasma theorists.  At the time, these theories were correct and supported by very intelligent and skilled scientists.  It’s possible that we can continue to discover new phenomena associated with dark matter and it will morph into a slightly different, but correct theory.  However, I think it is equally likely that we will find a new way of thinking about dark matter, and discover that the new way opens up new physics.  It’s always “different this time”, and it’s easy to blow off the past theories because we now know how wrong they were; however, at the time, these theories were correct, cutting edge science.  Researchers were constantly making progress in the theories and proposing extensions to them to fit new information.  Like chemistry was to miasma, it is also possible that the theory to replace dark matter has already been postulated, but has not gained widespread acceptance.
