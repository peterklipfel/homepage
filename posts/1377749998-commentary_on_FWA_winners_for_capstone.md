# Commentary on [FWA Winners](http://www.thefwa.com/site/lotus "FWA Winners")

I was impressed by the two sites that used scrolling with javascript to tell a story.  The first was [Your Tour by Google](http://yourtour.withgoogle.com/ "Your Tour"), and the second was the [Hollow Documentary](http://www.hollowdocumentary.com/ "Hollow Documentary").  The only thing that I would change about the sites would be the loading.  It's a tough problem, but _Your Tour_ loaded almost all of the necesary assets before allowing the user to continue.  Had they loaded all the assets asynchronously, they could have just slowed the scroll speed until the next assets were ready.  For some reason, The _Hollow Documentary_ stopped working for me when I tried it again later (to see if it was loading asynchronously)


The first website that caught my eye was [Watchdogs WeareData](http://www.thefwa.com/site/watchdogs-wearedata "Watchdogs WearData").  My first thought when seeing this was that it must be implemented in WebGL.  I was wrong.  I don't fully understand what is going on, but from a quick look at the source, it looked like it was just using some css  and a surprisingly small amount of javascript.  Wrong again.  It was actually flash.  I read an article once that mentioned that we took a step backward by deprecating flash because of the amazing things that are possible with it.  However, this was when flash was deprecated, and we've come a ways since then.  WebGL is more powerful than flash, but is more difficult to use, and javascript + HTML5 is catching up to where flash left off.  Hopefully soon we'll start seeing very advanced flash-like sites that are implemented entirely in web standards.
