My thesis project is a way for people to interact with music in a way that they might not always think about.  When you use Pandora or Spotify or any other service that suggests music, the service is (usually) comparing songs to each other to find how closely they match.  They also compare the songs that you like so as to suggest the correct songs to you.  My installation gives people a way to interact with recommendations live.  This will hopefully better explain how some of these recommendations are done, and help identify some of the problems that are faced.  For example, there are often one or two songs that seem to show up often when looking for new songs.

My project simply minimizes the distance between the the point it was given (what the user chooses) and all the songs in the database.  This is done using the distance formula over the 6 dimensional space that represents the different attributes of the song.  If there were 3, you could imagine them as x, y, and z.
