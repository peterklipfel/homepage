# Capstone Project Creative Brief

For my project, I am planning on creating a streaming music service that will recommend songs that people uplaod to it.  I love listening to new music.  I like hearing all the types of music that people are capable of creating.  Even with streaming services like [Pandora]("http://pandora.com") a [Spotify]("http://spotify.com"), you often get stuck into a certain type of music.  I would like something that takes me all over the place with new music all the time.  With that said, I also want some coherence to the mix.  Over the summer I was blown away by the [echonest api]("http://echonest.com").  It contains a huge number of features, and enabled me and a friend to build an automated remix engine in 18 hours.  I would like to use this in combination with node.js to create a streaming service that offers people a chance to listen to all kinds of music.  This project would probably be best displayed in the atlas lobby.
