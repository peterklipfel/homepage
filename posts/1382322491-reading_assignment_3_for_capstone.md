# Reading Assignment 3 For Capstone
<br><br>
My favorite piece was [Random Access Mortalities]('http://www.mteww.com/RAM/ram.html').  I was surprised that such a thing could be pulled off so cleanly so long ago (in internet time).  Automating remixes of songs (on the internet) was something that I thought had only been done in the last 2-3 years.  While it might be a crude remix, it is a remix nonetheless.  My opinion is slightly divergent from the author's in that the purpose of the work was supposed to show the mangling of media by machines.  Perhaps the reason for this is that I have seen what was to come.  I have seen that computer interaction with music is powerful can be useful for creative endeavors.  This piece doesn't have a very collaborative element to it, unless you count the preprogrammed song choices as collaboration.  However, the user interaction with the piece complements its purposes well.  It feels very random and a bit out of control.
