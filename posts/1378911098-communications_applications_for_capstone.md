# Communications Applications For Capstone

Video microblogging is a relatively new way for people to share snippets of their lives with people.  Services like [Vine](https://vine.co/ "Vine"), [Instagram](http://instagram.com/ "Instagram"), and [Snapchat](http://www.snapchat.com/ "Snapchat").  It was, of course, born out of microblogging platforms, but gives a new way to consume content.  People can now take 10 second videos and broadcast them to the world.  A place that I have not yet seen this technology, but would like to is in the news space.  I _don't_ mean that I would like CNN to start showing Vines, but rather that I would like to see Syrians posting vines of things that are happening in their country.  It would be interesting to use the platform to provide insights into how revolutions happen, why there are civil wars in developing countries, etc.
