# Portfolio Creative Brief (For Capstone)
<br><br>

The current iteration of my personal site follows the trendy flat style.  I'd like to keep it that way for the remainder of the semester, and work on making the rest of the site really pop.  If you look at the [Projects](/projects "Peter Klipfel's Projects"), [Resume](# "Peter Klipfel's Resume"), and [Music](# "Furious Hush's Music") sections of my website, you will notice that they need some help.  I have some [WebGL projects](https://github.com/peterklipfel/webgl_music_visualizer "Music Visualizer") that I would like to showcase, and I think that a way similar to the way [Mr. Doob](http://www.mrdoob.com/ "Mr. Doob") organizes his projects would be a good way to show them off.  However, I think that his design could use some work, and I would like to draw some inspiration from [Fusion Ads](http://fusionads.net/ "Fusion Ads") for design.  They have some nice, subtle effects on their page.  For the music and resume section I would like to emulate some of the graffiti effects on the [Grieves](http://www.grievesmusic.com/ "Grieves") website.  This section will not follow the rest of the site design.  The resume section should look clean and professional.  I really like the way that [Devon Tivona](http://tivona.me/ "Devon Tivona") designed his cv.  I would like to do something similar.
