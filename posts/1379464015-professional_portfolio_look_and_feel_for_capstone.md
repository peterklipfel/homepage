# Professional Portfolio Look And Feel For Capstone
<br><br>
My old website looked like this
<br><br><br>
<%= image_tag "oldHomepage.png" %>
_Home Page_
<br><br><br>
<%= image_tag "oldResume.png" %>
_Resume_
<br><br><br>
<%= image_tag "oldBlog.png" %>
_Blog_
<br><br><br>
so I updated it to look like the site that you're looking at.
<br>
Currently, the music page points to my soundcloud, but I would like to own that section of my website.  I would like to break the style a bit because it is a facet of my non-professional life.  So I started by adding my tag as the background of the page.
<br><br><br>
<%= image_tag "musicPage.png" %>
_Future Music Page_
<br><br><br>
but it looked way too busy, so I backed off, and left only the spraypaint
<br><br><br>
<%= image_tag "musicPageClean.png" %>
_Cleaned Music Page_
<br><br><br>
I am still looking into how I can incorporate my tag somewhere on the page without it looking too busy, but the soundcloud widget includes some images as well.
