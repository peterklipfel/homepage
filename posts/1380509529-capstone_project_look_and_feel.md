# Capstone Project Look And Feel
<br><br>
Because the backend of my project is rather complicated, I wanted to try to keep the interface as simple as possible.  I was debating whether or not to show the song names and artists, and decided against it.  Streaming music is beginning to define the way that music is consumed.  A side effect of this is that people don't really care about the artist or song.  So many songs now are variations on a theme (otherwise known as remixes) that most of my friends don't listen to songs more than three times.  And furthermore, they don't care who made them.

_However_, I am adding the artist information for the purposes of attribution to artists in case I'm wrong about displaying the information.

Again, the design is simple and minimalistic.
